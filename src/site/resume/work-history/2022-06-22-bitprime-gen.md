Accepted a full-time contract with BitPrime, a Cryptocurrency retail and OTC exchange based in New Zealand.

Primary responsibilities:
 - Rolling out new website features from design to deployment
 - Maintaining the website code and the server that hosted it

Things I learnt:
 - dos and don'ts of working with a remote team


 Sadly BitPrime was shut down in June 2022 due to a drastic drop in the crypto market. I held out hope BitPrime would land a contract to buy the business as a whole, but unfortunately could only secure a sale of its assets in July.
