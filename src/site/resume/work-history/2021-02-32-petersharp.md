Started a Web development side hustle while working full-time for Barkers (through Stafford recruitment) and the Fairlie Bakehouse. From June 2021 I started developing my freelance business full-time.


While I have had a few propective clients, this has mostly been a time of learning.

Things I learnt:
 - Cold-call/email marketing techniques
 - The difference between an estimate, a quote and a proposal
 - Strategies for minimizing risk in business
 - How to set up and use a sales-pipeline
 - How to use the Serverless Framework to run Python and Nodejs functions on AWS and Azure
 - How to use Playwright to convert my resume page into a PDF

Primary responsibilities:
- Self promotion
- Research and development
- Quotes and estimates
- Website development
