Started a Web development side hustle while working full-time for Barkers then Fairlie Bakehouse. From June 2021 I started developing my freelance business full-time.

While I had a few prospective clients, this was mostly a time of developing my business and technical skills.

Achievements:
 - Learnt how to run Node.js and Python functions on AWS and Azure using the Serverless Framework
 - Created a process to convert my resume page into a PDF using Playwright
 - Gained client interest on a estimate converting a spreadsheet into a web app. (Which I had to turn down after starting contracting for BitPrime)
