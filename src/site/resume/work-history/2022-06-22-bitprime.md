Accepted a full-time contract with BitPrime, a Cryptocurrency retail and OTC exchange based in New Zealand.

Primary responsibilities:
 - Rolling out new features from design to deployment
 - Application and server maintenance

Things I learnt:
 - dos and don'ts of working with a remote team
 - building serverless apps with SST
 - KYT and KYC AML workflow processes
 - Integrate Google sheets in Python and Node applications
 - Unit testing in Python
 - AWS secrets API
 - APIs for a variety of crypto exchanges and services
 - Creating widgets for Elementor
 - Creating mockups and designs in Figma


 Sadly BitPrime was shut down in June 2022 due to a drastic drop in the crypto market. I held out hope BitPrime would land a contract to buy the business as a whole, but unfortunately could only secure a sale of its assets in July.
