Accepted a full-time contract with BitPrime, a Cryptocurrency retail and OTC exchange based in New Zealand.

Achievements:
 - Reduced trading bot downtime from a couple of times per week to occasionally every few months.
 - Redesigned and developed About page cutting design costs.

Sadly BitPrime was shut down in June 2022 due to a drastic drop in the crypto market. I held out hope BitPrime would land a contract to buy the business as a whole, but unfortunately could only secure a sale of its assets in July.
