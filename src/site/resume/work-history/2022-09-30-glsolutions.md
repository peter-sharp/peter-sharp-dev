Promoted from QA Specialist on November 23, 2022

Transitioned from a small-company fullstack PHP developer role to a Configuration Specialist in a large-company environment, focusing on XPATH/XML, MSSQL, and .NET VB. This role required enhanced teamwork and collaboration, working closely with colleagues in roles I previously handled independently.

Key Achievements:
 - Optimized Efficiency: Reduced link creation time for temporary files by approximately 90%.
 - Improved Team Performance: Eliminated issues related to cached CSS/JS files, enhancing overall team efficiency.
 - Developed Tools: Created a file validation utility that decreased team implementation time by roughly 40%.
